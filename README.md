# UFOs

## Overview of the Analysis

## Results: There is a description of how to perform a search, with images. 

UFO sightings can be searched in five ways. Those Five ways are:

#### By Date

## Summary:

### One drawback of this webpage 
One drawback of the website that is almost immediately apparent is the the site only only accepts lowercase input. For example, if one where to put 'CA' (California abbreviation) instead of 'ca' in the 'Enter State' field, no results would post. See images below.

Image on left with 'CA' in 'Enter State' field shows no results, while image on right with 'ca' input in same field yielded all results for California.

### Two additional recommendations for further development

My first recommendation would be to add photos of sightings if any were avaiable for a particular sighting. If avaiable for a sighting I would create thumbnail of photo with the filtered results that could be clicked on. The website seems to need a photo, or something under the " UFO Sightings: Fact of Fancy? Ufologists Weigh In" banner. Perhaps when filter results are returned one of the photos for the filtered results could show there.

Second recommendation would be to accept capital letters misspellngs or alternate spellings to some degree in the fields for filtering. A few examples would are below in table.
